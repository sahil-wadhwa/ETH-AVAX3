# Project Title

For this project, I have written a smart contract to create my own ERC20 token and deploy it using HardHat or Remix. Once deployed, I was able to interact with it for my walk-through video. The contract owner should be able to mint tokens to a provided address and any user should be able to burn and transfer tokens.

## Description
